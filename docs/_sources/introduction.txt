GlueLang
==================================

|  GlueLang is a shell scripting language not for interaction but scripting. 
| In GlueLang, we try realizing following things:

*  to clear the role of shell
    * We think that shell scripting languages exist for description of process handling.
      It is not for implementing program in a process. However, existing shells
      look like imitations of programming languages for single process programming.
      We think that various gimmicks in shell scripting languages for imitation confuse beginner
      Unix and Linux users.
