GlueLang
==================================

 GlueLang is a shell scripting language not for interaction but scripting. In GlueLang, we try realizing following things:

*  to clear the role of shell

    * We think that shell scripting languages exist for description of process handling.
      It is not for implementing program in a process. However, existing shells
      look like imitations of programming languages for single process programming.
      We think that various gimmicks in shell scripting languages for imitation confuse beginner
      Unix and Linux users.

* to be convenient

    * We add the following features for the shell:

      * temporary files that can be created and destroyed easily
      * friendly error messages 
      * structured exit status numbers
      * indifference toward the SIGPIPE signal
      * ...
